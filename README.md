## Project

You can clone my project at this [link](https://github.com/nicolotoffanetti/exercise). A description of how to run it is provided inside the README.txt file in the main repository. 
I set up a small tutorial about principal component analysis,the example is relatively scholastic. The program exploits a dataset which is imported from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/). This dataset contains information about the characteristics of some plants (iris-versicolor, iris-setosa, iris-verginica), specifically sepal-length, sepal-width, petal-length and petal-width. The program will perfrom a principal component analysis decomposition in two dimension and then it will produce a graph, namely the scatter plot obtained as a result of the dimensional decomposition (scattet_plot.png).

I would like to mention that I am not a python developer, my professional background is definitely more oriented on c++. I used python aiming at avoiding problems for what concerns environmental compatibility (compiler version and etc.).

Enjoy!
